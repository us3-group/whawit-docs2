## What the WHAWIT API does

The WHAWIT API lets you automate and extend the platform so it fits cleanly into your existing tooling.
Typical use cases include:

- Syncing incident and insight data into ticketing systems.
- Building custom internal dashboards on top of WHAWIT’s incident understanding.
- Managing services, environments, and integrations as code.
- Exporting recommendations and code-level findings into your engineering workflow.

<Info>
  The examples in this section are placeholders. Replace them with real endpoints and payloads as your WHAWIT API stabilizes.

## Authentication

WHAWIT uses Bearer tokens for authentication.

```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN
```

Tokens should be kept secret and rotated regularly.
Use environment variables or your secrets manager rather than hard-coding tokens in source control.

## Example endpoints

The starter kit includes placeholder endpoints that you can repurpose for WHAWIT:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="List incidents"
    icon="list"
    href="/api-reference/endpoint/get"
  >
    Replace with an endpoint that lists recent incidents with summaries, severity, and affected services.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Create recommendation"
    icon="wand-magic-sparkles"
    href="/api-reference/endpoint/create"
  >
    Replace with an endpoint for creating or tracking reliability recommendations.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Dismiss or resolve items"
    icon="check"
    href="/api-reference/endpoint/delete"
  >
    Replace with an endpoint that archives or resolves recommendations or incidents.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Incident webhooks"
    icon="bell"
    href="/api-reference/endpoint/webhook"
  >
    Replace with an endpoint that documents how WHAWIT posts incident and insight webhooks into your systems.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## OpenAPI specification

Once your WHAWIT API is defined, update `openapi.json` in this folder (or point to a remote spec) so the reference pages stay in sync with the live API.
Until then, treat the existing `openapi.json` and endpoint pages as scaffolding for future work.
