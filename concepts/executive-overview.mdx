## What WHAWIT is

WHAWIT is an **intelligent observability and autonomous reliability engineering** platform.
It sits on top of your existing observability stack (for example, Datadog, New Relic, CloudWatch, Elastic) and turns raw telemetry into explanations and improvements instead of just dashboards.

You keep your current tools for collecting and storing data.
WHAWIT adds an intelligence layer that understands incidents, reduces MTTR, and helps teams ship more reliable software with less manual toil.

## Business problem and impact

From the WHAWIT research whitepaper (`file://WHAWIT - Long Version.pdf`):

- **Downtime is extremely costly**: studies show averages around tens of thousands of dollars per minute and hundreds of thousands per hour, with many enterprises reporting over \$1M per hour for high-impact incidents.  
- **Engineering time is heavily taxed by incidents**: teams often spend 20–30% of their time on unplanned incident work and manual diagnostics instead of roadmap delivery.  
- **Telemetry and observability costs are exploding**: log and metric volumes grow much faster than budgets, and most organizations believe they are overpaying for observability relative to the value they extract.  

In this context, **MTTR is not just a technical metric—it is a financial KPI**.

## How WHAWIT helps

WHAWIT focuses on four main levers:

- **Faster incident understanding**: Automatically correlates logs, metrics, and traces into natural-language incident summaries and timelines, so responders can reach a working hypothesis in minutes.  
- **More effective on-call**: The On-Call Hub provides a single place for incident context, reducing confusion and dependency on a few experts.  
- **Better use of existing tools**: By sitting on top of your current observability stack, WHAWIT increases the value of what you already pay for instead of requiring a full replacement.  
- **Compounding reliability improvements**: Through its code feedback loop, each incident becomes an opportunity to harden the system, reducing both the frequency and severity of future outages.  

## ROI framing

While exact numbers will depend on your environment, the whitepaper highlights several drivers of return on investment:

- **Reduction in downtime**: Even a 30–50% reduction in MTTR for a handful of major incidents per year can translate into hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars saved.  
- **Recovered engineering time**: Reducing manual incident diagnostics can effectively return multiple FTEs worth of capacity to roadmap work.  
- **More rational observability spend**: WHAWIT helps you get more value from the telemetry you already collect and can inform more targeted data collection strategies.  
- **Strategic resilience**: Over a multi-year horizon, continuous, code-level improvements compound, making outages less frequent and less severe.
