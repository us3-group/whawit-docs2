## Overview

WHAWIT is designed as an intelligence layer that works with your existing tools rather than replacing them. Connect your observability platforms, version control systems, CI/CD pipelines, and incident management tools to get the most out of WHAWIT's capabilities.

## Observability platforms

WHAWIT ingests telemetry from the platforms you already use to collect logs, metrics, and traces.
