## Security and compliance

WHAWIT is built for organizations that take security seriously. Whether you operate in regulated industries, handle sensitive customer data, or simply require enterprise-grade guarantees, WHAWIT is designed to meet your requirements.

### SOC 2 compliance

WHAWIT maintains **SOC 2 Type II** certification, demonstrating our commitment to security, availability, and confidentiality. This means:

- Independent auditors verify our security controls on an ongoing basis.
- We follow industry-standard practices for access control, encryption, monitoring, and incident response.
- Enterprise customers can request our SOC 2 report as part of their vendor evaluation process.

<Tip>
  If your organization requires SOC 2 reports or other compliance documentation, contact your WHAWIT account representative.

### Enterprise-ready infrastructure

For organizations with strict compliance or data residency requirements, WHAWIT offers:

- **Data encryption** at rest and in transit using industry-standard protocols.
- **Role-based access control (RBAC)** to limit who can view incidents, configurations, and recommendations.
- **Audit logging** for all user and system actions.
- **Single sign-on (SSO)** integration with your identity provider (Okta, Azure AD, Google Workspace, and others).
- **Private deployment options** for organizations that require dedicated infrastructure.

## Data privacy and model training

WHAWIT takes a strict stance on data privacy:

<Warning>
  **We do not train models on your data.**
</Warning>

Your telemetry, incidents, code, and configurations are used solely to provide the WHAWIT service to your organization. Specifically:

- Your data is never used to train, fine-tune, or improve WHAWIT's underlying models.
- Your data is never shared with other customers or third parties.
- You retain full ownership and control of your data at all times.

This approach ensures that your proprietary systems, incident patterns, and codebase remain confidential, even as you benefit from WHAWIT's intelligent analysis capabilities.

## Custom GPU for enterprise

For enterprise customers with demanding workloads or strict infrastructure requirements, WHAWIT offers **custom GPU** options as part of our Enterprise plans.

### Why custom GPU?

- **Dedicated compute**: Your WHAWIT workloads run on dedicated GPU infrastructure, isolated from other customers.
- **Predictable performance**: No noisy-neighbor effects or resource contention during high-volume incident analysis.
- **Data locality**: Keep compute closer to your data for reduced latency and compliance with data residency requirements.
- **Scale on demand**: Provision additional GPU capacity during peak periods or large-scale incidents.

### How it works

1. Work with your WHAWIT account team to determine your compute requirements.
2. We provision dedicated GPU infrastructure in your preferred cloud region.
3. Your WHAWIT instance routes all model inference and analysis to your dedicated resources.
4. You get full visibility into usage and performance metrics.
