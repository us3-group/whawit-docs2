## Overview

WHAWIT is grounded in research on the economics of downtime, the human cost of incidents, and the telemetry explosion that strains observability stacks.
Use these whitepapers to brief technical and business stakeholders on why WHAWIT exists and how it improves reliability.

## WHAWIT: Intelligent Observability and Autonomous Reliability Engineering (Long version)

- **Format**: PDF  
- **Audience**: SREs, platform engineers, architects, technical leaders  
- **File**: `/papers/WHAWIT - Intelligent Observability.pdf`

This long-form research paper covers:

- The real cost of downtime across company sizes, including estimates of average revenue loss per minute and per hour.
- How MTTR and MTTD function as both reliability metrics and financial KPIs.
- The telemetry explosion: year-over-year growth in logs, metrics, and traces and its impact on infrastructure and SaaS spend.
- How organizations actually use logs in practice, and why most data is only touched during incidents.
- The economics of log storage and observability tooling (including overpaying, surprise cost spikes, and data reduction strategies).
- WHAWIT’s architecture as an intelligence layer on top of existing observability tools, including temporal, topological, and historical reasoning.
- The On-Call Hub and the autonomous code feedback loop that translates incidents into concrete improvements.

## WHAWIT: The vNext of Intelligent Observability (Short version)

- **Format**: PDF  
- **Audience**: executives, product leaders, finance, non-specialist stakeholders  
- **File**: `/papers/WHAWIT - The vNext of Intelligent Observability.pdf`

The short version focuses on:

- High-level downtime economics and why observability is a board-level concern.
- How WHAWIT reduces MTTR, recovers engineering time, and improves the ROI of existing observability investments.
- The core idea of WHAWIT as an intelligence layer that works with, not against, your current tools.
- The compounding effect of autonomous reliability engineering over time.
