## Project Auto-Detection

The extension automatically detects your Whawit project by matching Git remotes. The detection process:

1. Reads `.git/config` from your workspace folders
2. Extracts remote URLs (both HTTPS and SSH formats)
3. Normalizes URLs for comparison
4. Matches against repositories connected to your Whawit projects via GitHub integration

<Note>
Auto-detection requires a GitHub integration configured in Whawit with access to your repository.
</Note>
