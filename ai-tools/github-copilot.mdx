The Whawit VS Code extension integrates with GitHub Copilot, providing a chat participant (`@whawit`) and language model tools that give Copilot direct access to your observability data.

## Overview

With the Whawit Copilot integration, you can:

- Ask `@whawit` about incidents and analyses in natural language
- Use slash commands to fetch specific observability data
- Let Copilot access Whawit tools automatically when analyzing code
- Get AI-generated fix recommendations based on real incident data

<Note>
This integration requires both the Whawit VS Code extension and GitHub Copilot Chat to be installed and active.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

- VS Code with GitHub Copilot Chat extension
- Whawit VS Code extension installed and logged in
- A project selected in Whawit

## Chat Participant

The `@whawit` chat participant appears in GitHub Copilot Chat when the Whawit extension is active.

### Basic Usage

Type `@whawit` in Copilot Chat followed by your question:

```
@whawit What are the recent errors in my system?
@whawit Show me the latest analysis
@whawit Are there any open incidents?
```

### Available Commands

The chat participant supports five slash commands for specific actions:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/fix` | Get analysis context formatted for implementing fixes |
| `/analyze` | Get analysis context for investigating the codebase |
| `/explain` | Explain the current analysis in detail |
| `/incidents` | List recent incidents for the project |
| `/history` | Show recent analysis history |

## Command Reference

### /fix

Fetches observability analysis data and formats it for implementing code fixes.

**Usage:**
```
@whawit /fix
@whawit /fix redis connection errors
@whawit /fix urn:history:abc123
```

**What it returns:**
- Summary of the issue
- Root causes with confidence scores
- Code issues with file locations and suggestions
- Recommendations for fixing

<Tip>
After using `/fix`, Copilot has context about the issue and can help you implement the fix directly in your code.
</Tip>

---

### /analyze

Fetches analysis context for understanding and investigating codebase behavior.

**Usage:**
```
@whawit /analyze
@whawit /analyze high latency
@whawit /analyze urn:history:abc123
```

**What it returns:**
- Analysis summary and severity
- Detailed analysis text
- Affected entities and services
- Timeline of events

---

### /explain

Provides a detailed explanation of the currently loaded analysis.

**Usage:**
```
@whawit /explain
```

<Note>
You must first load an analysis using `/fix` or `/analyze` before using `/explain`.
</Note>

**What it returns:**
- Full summary
- Detailed analysis
- Severity with justification
- All root causes with evidence
- Complete recommendations list

---

### /incidents

Lists recent incidents for your selected project.

**Usage:**
```
@whawit /incidents
```

**What it returns:**
- Incident summary with severity indicator
- Current status (open, closed, resolved, etc.)
- Affected service name
- Creation timestamp

---

### /history

Shows recent analysis history for your project.

**Usage:**
```
@whawit /history
```

**What it returns:**
- Analysis titles and status
- Timestamps
- Severity levels
- URNs for reference in other commands

## Language Model Tools

Beyond the chat participant, Whawit registers five language model tools that Copilot can call automatically when relevant:

### whawit_getAnalysis

Fetches full analysis data from Whawit including root causes, code issues, and recommendations.

**When Copilot uses it:**
- When you ask about recent issues or errors
- When you reference a specific analysis by URN
- When context about system problems would help answer your question

**Input:**
- `urn` (optional): Specific analysis URN to fetch

---

### whawit_getIncident

Fetches incident details including correlated analysis data.

**When Copilot uses it:**
- When you ask about incidents or alerts
- When you mention severity levels (critical, high, etc.)
- When investigating production issues

**Input:**
- `urn` (optional): Specific incident URN
- `severity` (optional): Filter by severity level

---

### whawit_getCodeContext

Searches the project knowledge base for relevant architecture and technical context.

**When Copilot uses it:**
- When you ask how something works in the codebase
- When you need architectural context
- When looking for documentation about specific features

**Input:**
- `query` (optional): Search query for finding relevant context

---

### whawit_listAnalyses

Lists recent analyses from Whawit with URNs and summaries.

**When Copilot uses it:**
- When you ask for a list of recent issues
- When you want to see analysis history
- When choosing which analysis to investigate

**Input:**
- `limit` (optional): Maximum number of results (default: 5)

---

### whawit_getProjectInfo

Gets information about the current Whawit project including available contexts.

**When Copilot uses it:**
- When you ask about the project configuration
- When checking what integrations are available
- When verifying project setup

## Example Workflows

### Fixing an Incident

<Steps>
<Step title="Check for incidents">

```
@whawit /incidents
```

Review the list and note any critical or high severity incidents.

</Step>

<Step title="Get fix context">

```
@whawit /fix
```

This loads the most recent analysis with fix-oriented formatting.

</Step>

<Step title="Ask Copilot to implement">

With the analysis context loaded, ask Copilot:

```
Based on the Whawit analysis, implement the recommended fix for the Redis connection timeout issue
```

Copilot now has full context about the issue and can generate appropriate code changes.

</Step>
</Steps>

### Understanding System Architecture

<Steps>
<Step title="Load project context">

```
@whawit What is the architecture of the payment service?
```

Copilot uses `whawit_getCodeContext` to search the knowledge base.

</Step>

<Step title="Get detailed analysis">

```
@whawit /analyze payment processing flow
```

This fetches relevant analysis data about the payment system.

</Step>

<Step title="Ask follow-up questions">

```
@whawit /explain
```

Get a detailed breakdown of the loaded analysis.

</Step>
</Steps>

### Daily Incident Review

```
@whawit /history
@whawit /incidents
@whawit Show me the most severe issue from today and what's needed to fix it
```

## Follow-up Suggestions

After using `@whawit` commands, the chat participant provides contextual follow-up suggestions:

- **After loading an analysis**: "Explain Analysis" and "Fix Issues" options appear
- **After any command**: "View History" option for quick access to analysis list

Click these follow-up buttons or continue the conversation naturally.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="@whawit not appearing in Copilot Chat">

1. Ensure the Whawit extension is installed and active
2. Check that you're logged into Whawit (look for the status bar indicator)
3. Restart VS Code to reload the extension
4. Verify GitHub Copilot Chat extension is installed and working

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Commands returning no data">

1. Ensure a project is selected in Whawit
2. Verify the project has analysis history and/or incidents
3. Check the Output panel (`View > Output > Whawit`) for errors
4. Try running `/history` first to confirm connectivity

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Language model tools not being used">

1. Copilot decides when to use tools based on your prompt
2. Be specific in your questions to trigger tool usage
3. Mention "Whawit" or "observability" to hint at relevant tools
4. Use explicit `@whawit` commands for guaranteed tool access

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Tips for Best Results

<Tip>
**Be specific with queries**: Instead of "what's wrong?", try "what Redis errors occurred in the last hour?"
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Reference analyses by URN**: When you see a URN in `/history` output, use it directly: `@whawit /fix urn:history:abc123`
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Combine with code context**: After loading Whawit context, ask Copilot to look at specific files: "Now check `src/services/redis.ts` for the issue mentioned in the analysis"
</Tip>
