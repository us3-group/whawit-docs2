This page is for WHAWIT team members who maintain these docs.
End users of WHAWIT do not need to follow this guide.

## Local development

We use Mintlify to power this documentation site.

<Steps>
<Step title="Install the Mintlify CLI">

```bash
npm i -g mint
```
</Step>

<Step title="Preview locally">

From the docs repository root (where `docs.json` lives), run:

```bash
mint dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to view the docs.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Link checks

Before merging substantial documentation changes, run:

```bash
mint broken-links
```

Fix any reported issues before shipping.

## Editor setup

We recommend:

- [MDX VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=unifiedjs.vscode-mdx) for syntax highlighting.
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) for formatting.

See `essentials/markdown.mdx`, `essentials/code.mdx`, and `essentials/settings.mdx` for examples of components and configuration.
