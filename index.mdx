## Why WHAWIT

Modern systems rely on distributed architectures and third-party services, which makes outages both more likely and more expensive.
Downtime routinely costs from hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars per hour, and every extra minute of MTTR directly impacts the bottom line ([WHAWIT long whitepaper](file://WHAWIT - Long Version.pdf)).

At the same time, teams are overwhelmed by a telemetry explosion: logs, metrics, and traces grow faster than budgets.
Organizations routinely ingest hundreds of gigabytes of data per day, yet engineers still spend a large share of their time manually sifting through tools during incidents instead of building and improving systems.

WHAWIT is an **intelligent observability and autonomous reliability** platform that sits on top of your existing observability stack (Datadog, New Relic, CloudWatch, Elastic, and more).
Instead of adding yet another dashboard, WHAWIT turns raw telemetry into explanations, guidance, and code-level improvements.
